# Task: Remove translation strings

## Description
Remove all Text Replacements-related translation strings from all translation JSON files. This ensures no orphaned translation keys remain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All replacement-related keys removed from `strings.json`
- [x] All replacement-related keys removed from `translations/en.json`
- [x] All replacement-related keys removed from `translations/zh-Hant.json`
- [x] JSON files remain valid (no syntax errors)
- [x] No missing translation warnings in console

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `custom_components/ha_rebrand/strings.json`
  - `custom_components/ha_rebrand/translations/en.json`
  - `custom_components/ha_rebrand/translations/zh-Hant.json`
- Search for keys containing "replacement", "replace_key", "replace_value", etc.
- Ensure valid JSON structure after removal (check commas, brackets)
- May need to check for any other translation files in the translations directory

## Dependencies
- [x] None - translation changes are independent

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside any other task)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All replacement strings removed from all translation files
- [x] JSON files are valid
- [x] No console warnings about missing translations

## Completion Notes
Completed in commit `e1d8c5b`. Updated descriptions in all 3 translation files to remove "and text replacements" / "和文字替換" references.
