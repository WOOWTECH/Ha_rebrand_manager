# Task: Verify backward compatibility

## Description
Verify that the component works correctly after all removal tasks are complete. Test backward compatibility with existing configurations that contain `replacements` entries, and verify all other features continue to work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Component loads without errors when config contains `replacements` field
- [ ] Component loads without errors when config has no `replacements` field
- [ ] Admin panel loads and displays correctly (no Text Replacements section)
- [ ] Logo replacement feature works correctly
- [ ] Favicon replacement feature works correctly
- [ ] Color theming feature works correctly
- [ ] Sidebar customization feature works correctly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] No Python errors in Home Assistant logs

## Technical Details
- Test scenarios:
  1. Fresh install with no config
  2. Existing config with `replacements: {}` (empty)
  3. Existing config with `replacements: {"old": "new"}` (with data)
- Verify all other features by visual inspection in admin panel
- Check browser developer tools console for errors
- Check Home Assistant logs for Python errors

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Backend removal complete
- [ ] Task 002 - Injector removal complete
- [ ] Task 003 - Panel removal complete
- [ ] Task 004 - Translation removal complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (must run after all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No log errors
- [ ] All other features verified working
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
