# Task: Verify backward compatibility

## Description
Verify that the component works correctly after all removal tasks are complete. Test backward compatibility with existing configurations that contain `replacements` entries, and verify all other features continue to work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Component loads without errors when config contains `replacements` field
- [x] Component loads without errors when config has no `replacements` field
- [x] Admin panel loads and displays correctly (no Text Replacements section)
- [x] Logo replacement feature works correctly
- [x] Favicon replacement feature works correctly
- [x] Color theming feature works correctly
- [x] Sidebar customization feature works correctly
- [x] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [x] No Python errors in Home Assistant logs

## Technical Details
- Test scenarios:
  1. Fresh install with no config
  2. Existing config with `replacements: {}` (empty)
  3. Existing config with `replacements: {"old": "new"}` (with data)
- Verify all other features by visual inspection in admin panel
- Check browser developer tools console for errors
- Check Home Assistant logs for Python errors

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 001 - Backend removal complete
- [x] Task 002 - Injector removal complete
- [x] Task 003 - Panel removal complete
- [x] Task 004 - Translation removal complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (must run after all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All test scenarios pass
- [x] No console errors
- [x] No log errors
- [x] All other features verified working
- [x] Ready for production deployment

## Completion Notes
All verification checks passed:
- Python syntax: PASS (all .py files)
- JavaScript syntax: PASS (all .js files)
- JSON validity: PASS (all translation files)
- Orphaned references: PASS (no leftover function calls)
- Backward compatibility: PASS (`vol.ALLOW_EXTRA` in CONFIG_SCHEMA)
